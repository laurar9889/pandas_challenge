In this repository you will find 1 folder with a Jupyter notebook, which will walk you through the process followed to be able to manipulate, analyze and conclude from the data.
You will also find a summary with key highlighted findings, as well as some conclusions from the data.

Background: 2 dataframes were given in csv format which contains a list of schools, relevant numbers such as number of students, budget amounts, math and reading scores, among others. The conclusions will be helping the school board and mayor to make strategic decision pertaining the future of school budgets.

Assumptions: 
1. Assumed that all the schools given in the database will cover 100% of the existing schools in the city
2. Assumed that grades go from 1 to 100 (1 being the lowest, 100 being the highest score)
3. Assumed "size" refers to total number of students per school
4. Assumed that all students are paying tuition fees (no scholarships given)
5. Assumed that passing a subject will be when the score is equal or greater than 70.
